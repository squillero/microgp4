Description: MicroGP
        =======
        
        MicroGP is an evolutionary optimizer able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics in finding the optimal solution of generic problems. It is extremely versatile, being able to tackle problem those solutions are fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines.
        
        **Notez bien**: MicroGP4 v1.0 is currently in `pre-alpha <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha>`__ under active development. It is publicly available to get feedback from experienced users.
